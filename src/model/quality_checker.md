# Quality Assurance

Quality assurance is implemented by using the [demonstrator 4.2](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/fair-ds/ap-4-2-demonstrator/ap-4.2-data-validation-and-quality-assurance-demonstrator).  This software consumes data
files and data description schemas and returns an extensive report on the data quality mostly
intended for explorative analysis by humans, as well a condensed JSON file which is used by other
Software such as RuQaD.
